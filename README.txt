Instructions: 

1. `cd` to the root directory for this project.
2. run `python3 setup.py` in the terminal. ** This is to install all the required dependencies for the project **
3. run A5T1.py in the terminal to generate the SQLite database  (named: A5.db)
4. run A5T2.py in the terminal to populate the MongoDB database. (Not mandatory as the database is prepopulated and is hosted on the cloud)
5. Ready to run the tasks.
